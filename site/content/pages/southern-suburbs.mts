"html": "\n<section class=\"section\"><div class=\"shell text-column regional-guide\"><h2>Plumbing and electrical repairs in Southern Suburbs</h2><p>For a Southern Suburbs property, including <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Thornlie\">Thornlie</a>, report visible water, drainage changes and electrical faults as separate observations. Include the suburb, access contact and whether the request is for a home, rental, strata or managed property.</p><h3>Plumbing repairs, drainage and hot water</h3><p>Our Southern Suburbs service, including Thornlie, brings leak investigation, drainage work and hot-water repairs into a clear property repair plan. Dampness around a bathroom, water beneath a sink and an active pipe leak are different conditions. Our <a href=\"water-leak-detection-perth.html\">water leak detection service</a> establishes the source and access requirements before the repair scope is confirmed.</p><p>Where water is still escaping from a damaged pipe or connection, request <a href=\"burst-pipe-repair-perth.html\">burst pipe repairs</a> and explain the affected area and continuing flow. Opening work, the pipe repair and reinstating surfaces are separate scope items. We do not assume that every detection or repair quote includes painting, cabinetry or tiling.</p><p>For slow sinks, backed-up showers or recurring toilet blockage, our <a href=\"blocked-drains-perth.html\">blocked drain clearing and repairs</a> service assesses whether the concern is limited to one fixture or affects a wider section of drainage. Loss of hot water is handled through <a href=\"hot-water-problems-perth.html\">hot-water repair and replacement assessment</a>, with plumbing and electrical requirements considered for the existing equipment.</p><h3>Electrical repairs and installation</h3><p>Water and power issues sometimes occur within the same property, but they must not be treated as the same fault without inspection. Tell us about water near outlets, lighting or equipment when requesting <a href=\"power-faults-perth.html\">electrical fault finding and repairs</a>. Keep clear of wet electrical equipment; for immediate danger, move to safety and call 000.</p><p>We also assess repairs and planned changes to lights, switches and outlets. Identify the affected rooms and distinguish a failed fitting from a request for a new location. Our <a href=\"lighting-power-points-perth.html\">lighting and power point service</a> explains the connection, wiring and installation scope in the written quote.</p><p>Work is carried out by appropriately licensed plumbing and electrical trades. Licence details are available on request. Our local team has an independent office and repair team within {{ppp:shared:business.name:html}}.</p><h2>Written quote before work proceeds</h2><p>The written quote describes the investigation and agreed repair, with access work and surface restoration identified separately. A concealed leak can require a different scope from an accessible fixture connection. We explain that distinction so you can compare what is included rather than comparing two prices for different tasks.</p><p>Where assessment identifies plumbing and electrical requirements, the relevant tasks are coordinated in the approved scope. Repair, equipment replacement and additional work are explained before approval. Our published ranges remain planning guides, with the final work and price confirmed in writing for your property.</p><h2>Repair request and access details</h2><p>For a Southern Suburbs rental or managed property, keep the occupant report, work-order reference and approval contact together. If water spread or the availability of hot water changes after the original report, update the condition and time rather than leaving the booking based on an outdated description.</p><p>A repair request can cover more than one issue, but each room, fixture and symptom should be listed independently. This lets our team define the required trades and inspection sequence without an unsupported diagnosis from the occupant. Safe photos may be emailed; they are not a condition of requesting service.</p><p>Call <a href=\"tel:{{ppp:shared:business.localTelephone:html}}\">{{ppp:shared:business.displayTelephone:html}}</a> or <a href=\"contact.html\">request an on-site assessment and written quote</a>. You do not need to diagnose the fault before making contact.</p><h3>Suburbs within this service region</h3><p>Choose your suburb to prefill the property location in our contact form: <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Fremantle\">Fremantle</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=South%20Fremantle\">South Fremantle</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=East%20Fremantle\">East Fremantle</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Beaconsfield\">Beaconsfield</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Hamilton%20Hill\">Hamilton Hill</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Spearwood\">Spearwood</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Cockburn%20Central\">Cockburn Central</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Success\">Success</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Bibra%20Lake\">Bibra Lake</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Murdoch\">Murdoch</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Kardinya\">Kardinya</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Bateman\">Bateman</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Booragoon\">Booragoon</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Mount%20Pleasant\">Mount Pleasant</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Applecross\">Applecross</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Ardross\">Ardross</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Willetton\">Willetton</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Canning%20Vale\">Canning Vale</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Leeming\">Leeming</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Bull%20Creek\">Bull Creek</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=Myaree\">Myaree</a>, <a href=\"contact.html?suburb=O'Connor\">O&#39;Connor</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"service-areas.html\">all six Perth service regions</a> for our wider coverage.</p></div></section>" as TrustedHtml
